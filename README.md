## Ecomercell - Tech products ecommerce

Together with a start up of 5 people, we developed an electronic products ecommerce, with common elements within the shopping experience: cart, integrated payment method (Stripe), registration method (Auth0), email sending to inform the user , administrator panel, user panel, order control, stock control, reviews, among other features that we consider necessary.

Here is the home, where you can see the promotional banner and the general widescreen to interact with the web.

When you click on the category bar (located below the navBar) you can see the products related and also use the filter/sort bar.

By clicking on details button (located on each product card) you can see the detail page; here is the complete description and reviews posted by other users. An important feature here is that you can not set a review of a product until buy and be logged.

Once you add products to the shopping cart (by clicking on the cart icon on cards or in the detail page) the cartPage is ready to be shown with the amounts per product, before taxes, and total amount to pay.

Here you have to fill the shipping info and loggin to proceed, other way the proceed button gonna be disabled.
